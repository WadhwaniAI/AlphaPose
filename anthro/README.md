# README
- To run alphapose on a set of subjects, populate the file input_ids.txt with the list of subjects
- Then execute `bash anthro/compute_kp_and_save.sh` from outside this folder
- To visualize kps generated by Alphapose (image wise) use the Visualize_AP_outputs.ipynb notebook


## Errors
- If you face a permission denied error, change the files ../coco.sh and ../halpe.sh such that outdir is different from indir. When stable, we will ensure that outdir is same as indir
