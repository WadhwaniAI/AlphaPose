# INSTALLATION / SETUP
- To setup alphapose follow the link - https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md - The conda pathway is preferred
- Download configs and models. [Halpe models](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/blob/master/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md#halpe-dataset-26-keypoints) and [FastPose DUC Resnet-50 unshuffle](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/blob/master/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md) 
 
# GENERATING KPS for anthro dataset
- To run alphapose on a set of subjects, populate the file input_ids.txt with the list of subjects
- Then execute `bash anthro/compute_kp_and_save.sh` from outside this folder
- To visualize kps generated by Alphapose (image wise) use the Visualize_AP_outputs.ipynb notebook


## Errors
- If you face a permission denied error, change the files ../coco.sh and ../halpe.sh such that outdir is different from indir. When stable, we will ensure that outdir is same as indir
